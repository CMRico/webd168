          Hello, I'm Cesar Meza Rico, I started coding this year as I've decided
          to choose this career path. This wasn't my first choice before because
          I didn't believe I was smart enough or confident enough to do this as
          a career before. This year has changed a lot of things in my life
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          Before this, I thought I was going to be a mechanic to be more precise
          an automotive technician, I was interested in it but as continued to
          study the subject I realized I loved it more as a hobby than I would
          like to do it as a job.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          I coded a little bit in high school and I used to think that this was
          very cool but I never thought I could try making it a career. I've
          been an active person for as long as I can remember so this was
          definitely not in my top choices as a career but I've learned a
          handful of things and I have fallen in love with this and can see
          myself doing it for a job as something that I like.
