      Hello, I'm Cesar Meza Rico, I started coding this year as I've decided to
      choose this career path. This wasn't my first choice before because I
      didn't believe I was smart enough or confident enough to do this as a
      career before. This year has changed a lot of things in my life
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this, I thought I was going to be a mechanic to be more precise an
      automotive technician, I was interested in it but as continued to study
      the subject I realized I loved it more as a hobby than I would like to do
      it as a job.
    </p>
    <p>
      I coded a little bit in high school and I used to think that this was very
      cool but I never thought I could try making it a career. I've been an
      active person for as long as I can remember so this was definitely not in
      my top choices as a career but I've learned a handful of things and I have
      fallen in love with this and can see myself doing it for a job as
      something that I like.
